TLDR

- Firefox 144 Integrates Key Web Standards: Firefox version 144 significantly improves web compatibility by adding long-awaited support for critical features like the View Transitions API and the `element.moveBefore` API.

- Enhanced Web Development and User Experience: The adoption of the View Transitions API in particular is a "massive change," enabling developers to create smoother, more dynamic web experiences with less effort, and reducing historical friction caused by Firefox lagging behind other browsers.

- Resolution of Long-Standing Bugs: Firefox 144 finally fixes a 15-year-old bug related to gradient rendering (dithering) and improves WebRTC handling for non-standard video resolutions and data channel transfers, addressing specific developer frustrations.

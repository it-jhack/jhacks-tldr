TLDR

- Irrational Language Choices: Engineers frequently make irrational programming language choices, leading to unproductive debates and significant business costs.

- Identity Over Technology: Language decisions are primarily driven by developer identity, emotion, and ego rather than objective technical merit or rational business needs.

- Consequences of Identity-Driven Decisions:
    - Financial Devastation: Unnecessary language migrations can lead to catastrophic business outcomes, including collapsed velocity, massive increases in operational costs, shortened financial runways, and market opportunity loss.
    - Significant Technical Debt: Technology stack decisions can account for 40-60% of total development costs over a product's lifecycle, with developers spending up to 42% of their time on tech debt exacerbated by poor choices.
    - Suboptimal Outcomes: Decisions based on hype or personal attachment (e.g., advocating Rust when Go is objectively better by stated criteria) override sound evaluation.

- Neuroscience of Bias: The brain reacts to challenges to identity-based beliefs as if under physical attack (activating the amygdala), hindering objective evaluation. To truly consider an alternative, one must imagine an alternate version of themselves, a process the brain resists.

- Reframing the Discussion: Instead of asking "Which language is best?", the focus should shift to "What will this language cost us?" This includes evaluating impact on velocity, tech debt, hiring difficulty, and operational complexity. Language selection should be treated as a measurable economic decision.

- Actionable Strategy for Decision-Making: To mitigate bias, have proponents of different language choices argue for the opposing language. This forces a critical examination of alternatives and can expose underlying biases or foster a more comprehensive understanding.

- Prioritize Shipping: Often, the technology currently in use is "good enough." Focus on delivering value and shipping products rather than constantly seeking technically "perfect" or fashionable language choices.

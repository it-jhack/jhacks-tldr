TLDR

AI is significantly reshaping the tech job market, leading to a demonstrable decline in junior roles while senior positions increase, driven by companies anticipating AI-driven automation and finding AI tools more efficient than human juniors, particularly under average management. This shift jeopardizes traditional learning paths for new engineers, making it critical for aspiring professionals to proactively build trust, network, and seek advice from experienced individuals to adapt and thrive in an increasingly AI-integrated workforce.

To navigate this landscape effectively, juniors must avoid self-pity or blaming external factors, focusing instead on proactive engagement. Build trust and expand your network by being genuinely useful and interesting in technical communities, such as making meaningful contributions to open-source projects. Prioritize asking senior professionals for career advice, rather than immediate job requests, to foster genuine connections. Crucially, seek out and surround yourself with individuals more competent than you to accelerate your learning and demonstrate real-world value beyond conventional credentials.

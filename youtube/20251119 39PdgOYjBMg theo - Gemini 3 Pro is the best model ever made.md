TLDR

- New AI Leader: Gemini 3 Pro is positioned as the new leader in AI, particularly strong in UI design and general capabilities.

- Significant Leap in AI Capability: Gemini 3 Pro represents a major advancement, particularly in multimodal understanding (processing audio, video, images, PDFs) and achieving new state-of-the-art benchmark results, including leading performances in Humanity's Last Exam and ARC-AGI-2.

- Cost-Inefficiency: It is token-hungry (third heaviest model) and significantly more expensive ($2/million in, $12/million out for <200k context; $4/$18 per million above 200k). Benchmark costs were 12x higher than standard GPT 5.1.

- Intelligent but Quirky Execution: The model is extremely intelligent but often exhibits quirky, sometimes unreliable behavior, including a high hallucination rate (88%) and a need for constant user oversight ("babysitting") to verify its outputs, impacting its real-world usability.

- Vendor Lock-in: Currently, Gemini models are exclusively available through Google's infrastructure (GCP).
